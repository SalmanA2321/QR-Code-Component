### What I learned

While developing this project I came across a problem. That made me learn the value of practicing things.

Recently I learnt the concept of Utility Classes in CSS. I was using that concept in this project as well but also I was using the main css in the same file as of the utility classes thus code was not working properly. Then after several attempts I just copied my design code and pasted it above my utility classes and it worked. Since CSS cascades I think that's why they were causing the problem.

### Continued development

I want to put my focous on learning how CSS cascades so I may not face similar problems in the future.
